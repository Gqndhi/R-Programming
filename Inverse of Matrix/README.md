Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather 
than compute it repeatedly. 

makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. 


For this assignment, assume the matrix used is always invertible.
